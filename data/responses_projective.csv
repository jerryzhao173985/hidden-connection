p_001,"Home office, 11pm. Dual monitors with dark mode everything, mechanical keyboard, good headphones playing lo-fi. Hot tea. Terminal split between vim and a running test suite. The satisfying rhythm of write-test-refactor when everything's flowing.","Production incident at 2am – service degradation traced to a memory leak in a feature I'd shipped. Slack blowing up, metrics dashboards red. Coped by: methodically walking through recent commits, adding targeted logging, resisting the urge to just revert blindly. Fixed it, wrote the postmortem, then couldn't sleep anyway.","Pair programming session where my teammate didn't just wait for their turn to type – they actually tracked my reasoning, caught a subtle race condition I was about to introduce, and explained why without making me feel stupid. That kind of engaged collaboration is rare.","Sleep in. Morning coffee while tinkering with a side project – maybe that iOS app idea I've been sketching, or some generative art in Swift/Metal. Afternoon vibe coding: no PRs, no tickets, just following curiosity. Evening: good food, maybe a tech talk on YouTube, early to bed.","""Builder"" - I like making things work – fixing broken builds, unblocking teammates, shipping features, building internal tools that save hours of manual work. The satisfaction is in the craft: clean APIs, tests that actually test something, code that's easier to read tomorrow than it was today.",builder
p_002,"In my cosy bedroom with a candle and many wool blankets, it is small there are two warm lights on either side of the bed, I have my laptop with me and I am with someone they have a book and we have a large pot of coffee to share.","I made a mistake in my workplace that effected other people. I had to write an apology email and contact my line manager who helped through it. I felt tired sweaty and very stressed. All I was thinking was shame and how much extra work I was causing other people, not only at work but also at home, I was on holiday visiting my family and I had to deal with the mistake. I took deep breaths and tried to think more reasonably about the situation, calculating the appropriate next steps to resolve it without letting myself get encumbered by regret.","This year a close family member has become quite sick, the response from my freinds has been very comforting most noticeably one friend who said they want to be there to support me. That reassured me that I wouldn't have to deal with it alone.","I would like to go to a coast on mediterranian sea maybe greece and have a fisherman show me how to eat sea urchins. My freinds would be with me, we would colect our urchins and have ouzo somewhere.",Dancing,dancing
p_003,"A cosy little home with a study, a games room, and a private cinema, nestled in a quiet, low-density neighbourhood within a city offering excellent transport links and infrastructure.","I'm currently preparing to apply for a PhD, but I've been procrastinating. I only started working on my assignments when the deadline was looming. On top of that, several tasks suddenly piled up at my part-time jobs, and all this work converged into one week. I felt extremely anxious. Yet I didn't take any action. I chose to sleep during the day to relax, only starting work late at night when it was quiet and no one disturbed me. My efficiency wasn't low initially, but it only shot up in the final two days before the deadline, allowing me to finish on time. I haven't adopted any methods that feel particularly effective—just sleeping and listening to music.","My classmates, I can sense they understand my recent anxiety, as we all tend to procrastinate until the last few days before tackling assignments. Simply by commiserating and sharing our progress, I realise their work pace is much like mine. This makes me less worried about not finishing my tasks in time.","I'll stay home alone, watching television series, films or gaming all day, before taking an evening stroll. If I feel like it, I might pop into the city centre to catch an exhibition, do a spot of window shopping or snap some photos of the scenery.","Laissez-faire. Because I seem to care little about most things, I take things as they come, drift along with the current, and accept all the unknowns with quiet resignation.",laissez
p_004,它在中东地区，像是一千零一夜里那种阿拉伯建筑。傍晚，天空是克莱因蓝，没有云朵，建筑被打上暖黄的光。会有少数轻微的交谈声和风声。可以看到有黑白斑马纹的骆驼被人牵着走向蓝色的沙漠里。,写不出来文献综述，不想看文献，发现AI给我假文献，但是算了一下日子要做不完作业了，又不想做，觉得自己没有科研能力。应对：吃好吃的，吃没了就睡觉，睡不着又起来调教了一次ai，然后告诉自己已经努力了，然后玩游戏或者玩手机，困了睡觉。,发朋友圈显示在伦敦，多年不联系的高中班主任私聊问我是去留学了吗，说很羡慕我，她这辈子估计也没机会出国，让我有空拍点照片给她看。这让我感觉被关注，我有空会拍照的，但是我只想发朋友圈，不想和她私聊，不是不喜欢她，是觉得好麻烦，还要和别人交流，也不知道交流什么，也不想交流，但是她都说了还是会给她发的，这是一种复杂的感觉。,看精力如何。如果不想动就宅一天，做饭或者点外卖，然后打游戏或者玩手机。如果天气不错精力也不错，就自己出去吃美食，吃完再买一些美食带回家，再买一杯奶茶，然后回来打游戏。,半死不活的。低精力人不想动就不动，但偶尔也想动一下。感觉生活本质很无趣，大多数时候没有想做的事，但偶尔也会有点，所以是半死不活的。,半死不活的

p_006,"I feel safe where I imagine home to be. And 'home' probably doesn't mean home with family and others. Since living on my own and actually alone in an apartment for a few years, my sense of safety comes from knowing how close I am to home. Whenever I'm returning from work or coming back from a road trip, I pretty much have my guard up the entire time and I'm on high alert but the moment I enter within a kilometre radius of my home, I start easing up and taking things slow. Home is also where I can be comfortable and take things at my own pace. I don't have to put up facades or be a certain way to fit in. I can fit in any way I like and my home will accommodate me. Whether it be on the messy, lazy days or the neat and tidy, home takes care of who I am and preserves my identity to a large extent. ","The most recent moment of stress came from just not being able to manage everything that I had going on in the way I had liked to. There was obviously work, my relationships, my hobbies and taking care of myself with cooking, cleaning and personal hygiene. All of it together coming at you is big ball of chaos that I was not ready for. For a while, I thought I could duck some of them and stay still and hope that they would go away on their own. It could also just be me being paralysed by the amount of things that needed my attention. Eventually, I realised I can't run away or hide or stay still and have to deal with it on my own. I started at the smallest of tasks and worked my way up from there. Bit by bit, I felt good enough to start doing more things and then move on to bigger issues and things that needed my attention. I started with my own self and room to begin with. I threw my dirty clothes to laundry, I folded all the clothes that were done drying, I tidied up my room. Then I proceeded onto shower and trim and make myself look presentable. That in itself was a big boost to my self-esteem and helped me move on to my work and relationships. ",,"It depends on what happened the previous day. If it was a very taxing day, then I'd want to spend the whole day in bed and be lazy. But if I had a good day and slept well, then I'd like to step out and go somewhere that I like going to often or someplace new. It's either for the feeling of comfort and safety from known places or feeling curious and sometimes adventurous to try or experience something new. I'm the kind of human who can spend a whole day at home or a whole day outdoors. I do both from time to time. ",Resilient,resilient

It is just a big body of water that I am in.","I actually feel burnt out pretty much every day, I just need to take time off doing things. I love going to sauna, it helps me feel less stressed.
