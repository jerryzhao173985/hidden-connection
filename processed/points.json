Terminal split between vim and a running test suite. The satisfying rhythm of write-test-refactor when everything's flowing.\nQ2 (stress): Production incident at 2am \u2013 service degradation traced to a memory leak in a feature I'd shipped. Slack blowing up, metrics dashboards red. Coped by: methodically walking through recent commits, adding targeted logging, resisting the urge to just revert blindly. Fixed it, wrote the postmortem, then couldn't sleep anyway.\nQ3 (understood): Pair programming session where my teammate didn't just wait for their turn to type \u2013 they actually tracked my reasoning, caught a subtle race condition I was about to introduce, and explained why without making me feel stupid. That kind of engaged collaboration is rare.\nQ4 (free day): Sleep in. Morning coffee while tinkering with a side project \u2013 maybe that iOS app idea I've been sketching, or some generative art in Swift/Metal. Afternoon vibe coding: no PRs, no tickets, just following curiosity. Evening: good food, maybe a tech talk on YouTube, early to bed.\nQ5 (one word): \"Builder\" - I like making things work \u2013 fixing broken builds, unblocking teammates, shipping features, building internal tools that save hours of manual work. The satisfaction is in the craft: clean APIs, tests that actually test something, code that's easier to read tomorrow than it was today.",

I had to write an apology email and contact my line manager who helped through it. I felt tired sweaty and very stressed. All I was thinking was shame and how much extra work I was causing other people, not only at work but also at home, I was on holiday visiting my family and I had to deal with the mistake.

I only started working on my assignments when the deadline was looming. On top of that, several tasks suddenly piled up at my part-time jobs, and all this work converged into one week. I felt extremely anxious. Yet I didn't take any action. I chose to sleep during the day to relax, only starting work late at night when it was quiet and no one disturbed me. My efficiency wasn't low initially, but it only shot up in the fin...\nQ3 (understood): My classmates, I can sense they understand my recent anxiety, as we all tend to procrastinate until the last few days before tackling assignments. Simply by commiserating and sharing our progress, I realise their work pace is much like mine. This makes me less worried about not finishing my tasks in time.\nQ4 (free day): I'll stay home alone, watching television series, films or gaming all day, before taking an evening stroll. If I feel like it, I might pop into the city centre to catch an exhibition, do a spot of window shopping or snap some photos of the scenery.\nQ5 (one word): Laissez-faire.
