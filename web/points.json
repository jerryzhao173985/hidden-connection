I'd sit on the worn wooden stool and feel like nothing bad could reach me there.\nQ2 (stress): Last month's project deadline hit hard. I couldn't sleep for three nights, kept reviewing the same documents. Eventually I went for long walks at 2am just to clear my head.

We watched terrible movies and she never asked what was wrong. She just knew.\nQ4 (free day): I'd wake without an alarm, make coffee slowly, read by the window for hours.

Just existing without purpose for once.\nQ5 (one word): Searching - because I always feel like I'm looking for something I can't name, some understanding or place or version of myself that's always just out of reach.",

I had to write an apology email and contact my line manager who helped through it. I felt tired sweaty and very stressed. All I was thinking was shame and how much extra work I was causing other people, not only at work but also at home, I was on holiday visiting my family and I had to deal with the mistake. I took deep breaths and tried to think more reasonably about the situation, calculating the appropriate next steps to resolve it ...\nQ3 (understood): This year a close family member has become quite sick, the response from my friends has been very comforting most noticeably one friend who said they want to be there to support me. That reassured me that I wouldn't have to deal with it alone.\nQ4 (free day): I would like to go to a coast on Mediterranean sea maybe Greece and have a fisherman show me how to eat sea urchins. My friends would be with me, we would collect our urchins and have ouzo somewhere.\nQ5 (one word): Dancing",

Slack blowing up, metrics dashboards red. Coped by: methodically walking through recent commits, adding targeted logging, resisting the urge to just revert blindly. Fixed it, wrote the postmortem, then couldn't sleep anyway.\nQ3 (understood): Pair programming session where my teammate didn't just wait for their turn to type \u2013 they actually tracked my reasoning, caught a subtle race condition I was about to introduce, and explained why without making me feel stupid. That kind of engaged collaboration is rare.\nQ4 (free day): Sleep in. Morning coffee while tinkering with a side project \u2013 maybe that iOS app idea I've been sketching, or some generative art in Swift/Metal. Afternoon vibe coding: no PRs, no tickets, just following curiosity. Evening: good food, maybe a tech talk on YouTube, early to bed.\nQ5 (one word): Builder - I like making things work \u2013 fixing broken builds, unblocking teammates, shipping features, building internal tools that save hours of manual work. The satisfaction is in the craft: clean APIs, tests that actually test something, code that's easier to read tomorrow than it was today.",

Since living on my own and actually alone in an apartment for a few years, my sense of safety comes from knowing how close I am to home. Whenever I'm returning from work or coming back from a road trip, I pretty much have my guard up the entire time and I'm on high alert but the moment I enter within a kilometre radius of my home, I start easing up and taking things slow. Home is also where I ca...\nQ2 (stress): The most recent moment of stress came from just not being able to manage everything that I had going on in the way I had liked to. There was obviously work, my relationships, my hobbies and taking care of myself with cooking, cleaning and personal hygiene. All of it together coming at you is a big ball of chaos that I was not ready for. Eventually, I realised I can't run away or hide or stay still and have to deal with it on my own. I started at the smallest of tasks and worked my way up from th...\nQ3 (understood): My classmates, I can sense they understand my recent anxiety, as we all tend to procrastinate until the last few days before tackling assignments. Simply by commiserating and sharing our progress, I realise their work pace is much like mine. This makes me less worried about not finishing my tasks in time.\nQ4 (free day): It depends on what happened the previous day. If it was a very taxing day, then I'd want to spend the whole day in bed and be lazy. But if I had a good day and slept well, then I'd like to step out and go somewhere that I like going to often or someplace new.\nQ5 (one word): Resilient",

I only started working on my assignments when the deadline was looming. On top of that, several tasks suddenly piled up at my part-time jobs, and all this work converged into one week. I felt extremely anxious. Yet I didn't take any action.
