Since living on my own and actually alone in an apartment for a few years, my sense of safety comes from knowing how close I am to home. Whenever I'm returning from work or coming back from a road trip, I pretty much have my guard up the entire time and I'm on high alert but the moment I enter within a kilometre radius of my home, I start easing up and taking things slow. Home is also where I can be comfortable and take things at my own pace. I don't have to put up facades or be a certain way to fit in. I can fit in any way I like and my home will accommodate me. Whether it be on the messy, lazy days or the neat and tidy, home takes care of who I am and preserves my identity to a large extent.",

It could also just be me being paralysed by the amount of things that needed my attention. Eventually, I realised I can't run away or hide or stay still and have to deal with it on my own. I started at the smallest of tasks and worked my way up from there. Bit by bit, I felt good enough to start doing more things and then move on to bigger issues and things that needed my attention. I started with my own self and room to begin with. I threw my dirty clothes to laundry, I folded all the clothes that were done drying, I tidied up my room. Then I proceeded onto shower and trim and make myself look presentable. That in itself was a big boost to my self-esteem and helped me move on to my work and relationships.",
